## 1. Enter a string of words separated by spaces. Find the longest word.
```longest_word.py```

## 2. Enter an irregular string (that means it may have space at the beginning of a string, at the end of the string, and words may be separated by several spaces). Make the string regular (delete all spaces at the beginning and end of the string, leave one space separating words).
```irregular_string.py```

## 3. Write a Python function, which will count how many times a character (substring) is included in a string. DON’T USE METHOD COUNT
```count_substring.py```

## 4. Find and replace a substring in a string for another substring. User enter from a keyboard a string and both substrings. DON’T USE METHOD REPLACE
```replace_stringd.py```
